# Planning GitHub Task Artifact Templates

> Read this file only when assembling, repairing, or validating a planning
> artifact. Keep full artifact contents out of the orchestrator summary.

Use these templates as the local artifact contract. External sources may inform
wording or rationale, but they do not replace these headings.

## Contents

- Execution Brief Template
- Execution Plan Template
- Test Specification Template
- Refactoring Recommendation Template

## Execution Brief Template

```markdown
# Execution Brief - <ISSUE_SLUG> Task <TASK_NUMBER>: <Title>

## Objective
<Concise task objective from the task plan.>

## Relevant Requirements and Context
<Only the requirements, decisions, and issue context needed for this task.>

## Implementation Notes
<Known implementation guidance, constraints, and assumptions.>

## Definition of Done
<Task-specific completion criteria.>

## Likely Files / Artifacts Affected
<Likely files, modules, tests, docs, configs, or generated artifacts.>

## Resolved Questions and Decisions
<Resolved questions, waived questions, decisions log entries, and re-plan decisions.>

## Constraints
<Scope boundaries for the eventual executor.>
```

## Execution Plan Template

```markdown
# Execution Plan - <ISSUE_SLUG> Task <TASK_NUMBER>: <Title>

## Codebase Summary
<Relevant files, local patterns, framework/tooling observations, and test conventions.>

## Recommended Skills
<Local skills that materially help implementation, or None.>

## Implementation Approach
<Ordered implementation sequence for the executor.>

## File-Level Strategy
<Per-file or per-module changes and why each belongs in scope.>

## Risks and Considerations
<Regression risks, migration risks, data concerns, operational concerns, and mitigations.>

## User Impact Assessment
<Concrete user-facing effect of each major implementation choice, or TBD.>

## Blockers / Ambiguities
<Only issues that must be resolved before reliable implementation.>
```

## Test Specification Template

```markdown
# Test Specification - <ISSUE_SLUG> Task <TASK_NUMBER>: <Title>

## Test Framework and Conventions
<Framework, file placement, helper, fixture, assertion, and mocking conventions observed.>

## Test Groups
<Behavior-oriented test groups with priorities and edge cases.>

## Definition of Done Coverage
<Mapping from definition-of-done item to planned automated check or explicit blocker.>

## Notes for Task Executor
<Setup notes, data fixtures, mocks, commands, and sequencing hints.>

## Blockers / Ambiguities
<Untestable or unclear requirements that need resolution.>
```

## Refactoring Recommendation Template

```markdown
# Refactoring Recommendation - <ISSUE_SLUG> Task <TASK_NUMBER>: <Title>

## Verdict
<Refactor before, Refactor during, or No refactoring needed.>

## Before Implementation
<Required cleanup before implementation starts, or None.>

## During Implementation
<Small cleanup safe to perform while implementing this task, or None.>

## Out of Scope
<Noted cleanup that should not be included in this task.>

## Impact on Existing Tests
<Expected test changes, unchanged tests, and regression checks.>

## Blockers / Ambiguities
<Ambiguity that prevents a trustworthy recommendation.>
```
