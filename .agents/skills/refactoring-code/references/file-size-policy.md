# File Size Policy

> Read this file only when the strategist or reviewer must justify, plan, or enforce a file split. Keep counted lines, waivers, and chosen patterns in structured handoffs; do not paste raw file contents back to the orchestrator.

`MAX_LINES` defaults to `250` and is the per-file ceiling for any file the refactor produces or modifies. The rule keeps modules cohesive, reviewable, and editor-friendly. A file above the ceiling indicates that the module is doing more than one job or is mixing concerns at different abstraction levels.

## Counting Policy

- Count physical lines as reported by the host editor or `wc -l`.
- Count blank lines and comments. Excluding them invites token-shaving by removing whitespace or notes.
- Count the file as it sits on disk after the refactor, not the diff size.

## When The Rule Applies

| Case | Apply rule? |
| ---- | ----------- |
| The original target file | Yes |
| New files produced by a split | Yes |
| Files modified as a direct compilation consequence | Yes |
| Files only referenced (no edits) | No |
| Test files modified to follow a rename | Yes |

## Permitted Waivers

Record any waiver explicitly in `STRATEGY` with the reason. Common waivers:

| Waiver | Example |
| ------ | ------- |
| Generated code | OpenAPI, GraphQL, Protobuf outputs |
| Static data | JSON fixtures, lookup tables, snapshot files |
| Single declaration | An auto-generated type or const block where splitting harms clarity |
| Framework-required single file | Migrations or schema files the framework loads as one unit |

Anything else requires either a split or a `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` from the strategist.

## Split Decision Tree

1. **Project architecture first.** Use the existing folder shape (e.g., `domain/`, `application/`, `infrastructure/`, feature folders, layered MVC). Place each extracted file where similar concerns already live.
2. **If no clear architecture exists**, split along these seams in order:
   - Pure decision logic and predicates.
   - Side-effect adapters (I/O, persistence, network, time, randomness, env).
   - Type definitions and contracts.
   - Orchestration that wires the above.
3. **Preserve the public surface.** Keep the original entry point and re-export only what existing callers already use.
4. **Avoid speculative layers.** Do not introduce an interface, factory, or registry just to make the move feel architectural.

## External Support

This policy is enough to decide and report size compliance. When a split seam needs article-backed support, use `./refactoring-web-resources.md` to fetch one matching source for cohesion, single responsibility, domain-shaped folders, Functional Core / Imperative Shell, move mechanics, or wrong abstraction risk.

## Reporting

In `STRATEGY`, include a size plan:

```text
File size plan:
- <path> -> <projected lines> [keep | split]
- New file <path> -> <projected lines> [extracted from <path>]
Waivers: none | <path>: <reason>
```

In `IMPLEMENTATION`, include the actual sizes:

```text
File sizes after change:
- <path>: <lines>
- <path>: <lines>
```

In `REFACTOR_REVIEW`, the size check passes only when every changed or created file is at or below `MAX_LINES`, or every overage has a waiver recorded in `STRATEGY`.
