## Fetch Policy

1. Apply the bundled playbook first. Fetch a URL only when exact CLI flags,
   REST/GraphQL fields, auth, pagination, rate limiting, sub-issue or
   project behavior, or progressive-disclosure rationale could change the
   next action.
2. Fetch only URLs listed in the **Source Routing** table. Treat links
   inside a fetched page as out of scope unless their destination is also
   listed.
3. Use at most two fetched pages per retrieval pass. Summarize the relevant
   detail in one or two sentences before applying it.
4. If fetching fails, proceed from bundled references when safe and record
   the uncertainty under `Warnings` if it affects completeness.

## When Network Is Unavailable

Continue with bundled references. Do not claim version-specific GitHub API
or CLI facts that were not verified. Use `FETCH: PARTIAL` when unavailable
source material prevents verifying child issues, linked issues, or project
membership after the parent issue was retrieved.
