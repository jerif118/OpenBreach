# Go Strict Rewrite Playbook

> Read this file only when the target is Go. Use it as a local rewrite guide:
> load external sources only when a concrete checker, standard-library, or idiom
> decision depends on them. Do not paraphrase external docs back into the report.

## Skill-Specific Defaults

- Preserve observable behavior and treat existing module, lint, and formatting conventions as the authority.
- Prefer concrete structs for stable shapes; use `map[string]T` only for genuinely dynamic key spaces.
- Keep `any` or `interface{}` at unavoidable generic, decoding, or adapter boundaries; convert to concrete values promptly.
- Return errors explicitly and handle them near where they occur. Pass `context.Context` when the surrounding code already follows that convention.

Anything not listed above defers to project evidence or to the external source
map in `./external-sources.md`.

## When To Fetch External Sources

Load `./external-sources.md` only for disputed idiom, public API
comments, package naming, error flow, context usage, JSON decoding behavior,
`go vet`, or Staticcheck diagnostics that affect the rewrite.

## Boundary Validation

For untrusted JSON and external records: prefer the standard library plus
explicit validation unless the project already uses a validation package. Decode
known shapes into structs, validate required semantic constraints after decoding,
and convert to concrete structs or domain values near the boundary instead of
passing `map[string]any` deeper.

## Validation Commands

Prefer the user's `VALIDATION_COMMAND`. Otherwise the smallest relevant existing project check: `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `staticcheck ./...`, `gofmt`, or `goimports`.
