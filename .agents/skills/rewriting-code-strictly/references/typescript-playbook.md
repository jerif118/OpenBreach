# TypeScript Strict Rewrite Playbook

> Read this file only when the target is TypeScript or JavaScript. Use it as a
> local rewrite guide: load external sources only when a concrete checker,
> validator, or syntax decision depends on them. Do not paraphrase external docs
> back into the report.

## Skill-Specific Defaults

- Preserve observable behavior and treat existing `tsconfig`, lint, and validator conventions as the authority.
- Replace broad `any` at untrusted boundaries with `unknown`, then narrow before use.
- Keep assertions local; replace them with narrowing, guards, or runtime schemas when feasible.
- Avoid deep generic machinery unless it removes real duplication or captures a stable public contract.

Anything not listed above defers to project evidence or to the external source
map in `./external-sources.md`.

## When To Fetch External Sources

Load `./external-sources.md` only for current annotation syntax,
narrowing behavior, strict `tsconfig` flags, `typescript-eslint` diagnostics,
Zod API choices, or unsoundness rationale that affects the rewrite.

## Boundary Validation

For untrusted JSON, API responses, webhooks, form payloads, config, and tool or
LLM outputs: parse once at the boundary with the project's validator, then pass
validated values internally. Add Zod only when the project already uses it or the
user explicitly permits the dependency.

## Validation Commands

Prefer the user's `VALIDATION_COMMAND`. Otherwise the smallest relevant existing project check: project tests, `tsc --noEmit`, ESLint, or the configured formatter.
