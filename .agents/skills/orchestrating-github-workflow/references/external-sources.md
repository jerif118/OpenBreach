# External Sources

> Read this file only when you need general background, setup details, or
> current API/CLI syntax. Fetch one URL at a time, summarize the result,
> and discard the raw page. The bundled workflow contracts in this skill
> package remain authoritative for execution.

This file is the only outbound knowledge hub for this skill. Every
context-heavy concept, setup instruction, and platform-syntax reference
lives behind a URL below so it can be retrieved just in time instead of
being preloaded into the orchestrator's prompt.

## Loading Rules

- Use bundled references (`./workflow-policy.md`, `./phases-1-4.md`,
 `./task-loop.md`, `./data-contracts.md`, `./error-handling.md`) for
 anything workflow-specific.
- Fetch an external URL only when (a) the bundled contract does not
 answer the question, and (b) the answer would otherwise force a long
 inline instruction.
- Fetch one URL at a time. Summarize, then move on.
- If a web source conflicts with a bundled contract, follow the bundled
 contract and surface the discrepancy only when it affects the user's
 decision.
- Do not paraphrase whole pages back to the orchestrator; return only
 the single fact or step the current decision needs.

## When To Fetch

| Trigger | Pick a URL from |
| ------- | --------------- |
| User asks why this workflow loads files just-in-time, or you must explain context engineering choices | [Concepts](#concepts) |
| `preflight-checker` reports a downstream skill `MISSING` / `UNKNOWN`, or the user needs skill installation / discovery help | [Agent skill runtime docs](#agent-skill-runtime-docs) |
| `preflight-checker` reports `gh MISSING` or the user needs setup / auth help | [GitHub CLI setup](#github-cli-setup) |
| You need the exact `gh` flag, JSON field, or REST/GraphQL endpoint for an issue read or write | [GitHub CLI / API syntax](#github-cli--api-syntax) |
| A subagent needs to know whether sub-issues, dependencies, or projects v2 are exposed for this repo | [GitHub Issues capabilities](#github-issues-capabilities) |
| You are authoring or revising a downstream skill or utility subagent and need design guidance | [Skill-authoring background](#skill-authoring-background-optional) |

## Skill-Authoring Background (optional)

Use this section only when the user asks how this skill itself was
written, or when extending this orchestrator with a new downstream skill.
None of these URLs need to be fetched during normal GitHub workflow
execution.

## How To Use Returned Web Content

When you fetch a source, condense it to one of these forms before
continuing:

```text
EXTERNAL_SOURCE: OK
Source: <url>
Used for: <decision or setup question>
Relevant facts:
- <fact 1>
- <fact 2>
Workflow impact: <none | changed next step | user action needed>
```

If the source cannot be fetched, fall back to bundled contracts when
possible and surface the missing external confirmation only when it
blocks the user:

```text
EXTERNAL_SOURCE: UNAVAILABLE
Source: <url>
Used for: <decision or setup question>
Fallback: <bundled contract or local heuristic used instead>
Workflow impact: <none | needs user action>
```
