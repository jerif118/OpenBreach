# External Sources

Read this file when an inline operational contract is not enough and you want
source-backed background, current platform syntax, or a method explanation.

> **Reminder:** This skill is designed to run offline. Bundled references are
> the execution contract. External URLs are optional just-in-time enrichment;
> proceed with the local references when network access is unavailable and
> avoid claiming version-specific platform behavior.

## Authority Model

Bundled references are the binding workflow contract. External sources replace
long static explanations and provide current syntax or rationale on demand; they
do not override user instructions, host system rules, or local output contracts.

## Fetch Policy

1. Apply the relevant bundled reference first. Fetch a URL only when the
   decision needs background concept material, current command syntax, or
   source rationale.
2. Fetch only URLs listed below. Treat links inside a fetched page as out of
   scope unless that destination is also listed here.
3. Fetch one source first; fetch a second only when the first does not answer
   the question. Limit yourself to two fetched pages per stage.
4. Summarize fetched content into the compact form below, then discard page
   details from working context unless they directly affect the decision.

## How To Use Returned Web Content

Summarize a fetched source into one of these forms before applying it:

```text
EXTERNAL_SOURCE: OK
Source: <url>
Used for: <decision or finding>
Relevant facts:
- <fact 1>
- <fact 2>
Workflow impact: <none | adjusted finding | added confidence note>
```

Do not embed long quotes from the page in any planning artifact. Cite the
source with a one-line link only when it directly affects a finding.
