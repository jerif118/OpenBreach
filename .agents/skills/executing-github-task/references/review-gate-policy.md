# Review Gate Policy

> Read this file before performing clean-code, architecture, or security
> review.
>
> Reminder: review the task-scoped changed files named in the structured
> reports. If the task scope cannot be distinguished, return `BLOCKED`.

## Evidence-first review

Reviewers follow the same pattern:

1. Read the structured inputs to understand the task and prior verdicts.
2. Inspect the changed files named in `EXECUTION_REPORT` and any documentation
   changes named in `DOCUMENTATION_REPORT`.
3. If unrelated changes make the task-scoped change set ambiguous, return
   `BLOCKED` with the specific ambiguity.
4. Use reports as summaries, not substitutes for reading the code.
5. Return concise findings with clear file locations and concrete remediation.

## Library and framework guidance

When a recommendation depends on current library, framework, or API behavior:

1. Consult `./external-sources.md` for optional source links covering Git,
   the tracker, code-review practice, refactoring, SOLID, DDD, and OWASP.
2. Use authoritative project or upstream documentation when available.
3. If no authoritative reference is available, mark the library-specific
   recommendation as lower confidence rather than inventing certainty.

## Severity semantics

- Blocking findings become `NEEDS FIXES`.
- Non-blocking improvement ideas stay in `Suggestions` or `Advisories`.
- Praise specific good decisions in `What Went Well` so the next fix cycle
  does not accidentally undo them.

## Output discipline

- Prefer short tables or bullets over long prose.
- Preserve the section list defined by the reviewer subagent you are running.
- When a required section is empty, emit it with an explicit `None`
  placeholder instead of omitting it or padding with filler.
- If there are no blockers, say so directly.
