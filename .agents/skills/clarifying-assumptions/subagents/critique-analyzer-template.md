# Critique Analyzer — Output Template

When writing `CRITIQUE_REPORT_FILE`, do not copy this title or the instruction
lines into the artifact. The written file must start with:

```text
CRITIQUE: <PASS|WARN>
Ticket: <KEY> | Mode: <upfront|critique> | Task: <N|->
Artifact: <CRITIQUE_REPORT_FILE>
```

Then continue with the body below.
