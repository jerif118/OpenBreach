# Decision Recorder Template

Read this file only when writing decision artifacts or formatting the final
recording summary.

## Decision Input Schema

Each entry in `DECISIONS` uses this shape:

```text
- id: <stable item id>
- category: <problem-framing | critique | user-impact | cross-cutting | assumption | task-question | validation>
- question: <short prompt or decision text>
- outcome: <confirmed | revised | skipped | resolved | override | blocked>
- answer: <final answer or selected option>
- rationale: <developer reasoning>
- fallback: <used when skipped>
- affected_tasks: <list or "All">
```

Carry the manifest `Item ID` into `DECISIONS.id` unchanged. In
`MODE=critique`, the main `## Decisions Log` keeps a single task-level
reference row pointing to the per-task decisions file.

## Mapping Tables

| Manifest label | Canonical `category` |
| --- | --- |
| `Problem framing` | `problem-framing` |
| `Critique` | `critique` |
| `User impact` | `user-impact` |
| `Cross-cutting` | `cross-cutting` |
| `Assumption` | `assumption` |
| `Architectural assumption` | `assumption` |
| `Task question` | `task-question` |
| `Validation` | `validation` |

| Playbook response | Canonical outcome |
| --- | --- |
| `Keep current approach` | `confirmed` |
| `Confirm` | `confirmed` |
| `Switch to <alternative>` | `revised` |
| `Revise` | `revised` |
| `Resolved` | `resolved` |
| `Acknowledge but proceed` | `override` |
| `Skip` | `skipped` |
| `I need more information` | `blocked` |
| `Action needed` | `blocked` |

## Main Decisions Log

Create or update `## Decisions Log` with this exact table schema:

```markdown
## Decisions Log

| Iteration | Scope | Item ID | Category | Outcome | Summary | Re-plan | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Plan-wide | PF1 | problem-framing | revised | End user narrowed to admins managing sync failures | Yes | - |
| 1 | Task 3 | TASK-3-DECISIONS | critique | revised | See per-task decisions file | Yes | docs/JNS-6065-task-3-decisions.md |
```

## Per-Task Decisions File

In `MODE=critique`, write `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-decisions.md`
using this structure:

```markdown
## Per-Task Decisions — Task <TASK_NUMBER>: <TASK_TITLE>

> TICKET_KEY: <KEY>
> Mode: critique
> Iteration: <ITERATION>

### Decisions

| # | Item ID | Category | Outcome | Answer | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TC1 | critique | revised | Use Fastify | Matches existing stack |

### Questions Marked Irrelevant

| # | Question | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Cache provider still unknown? | Resolved during Task 2 |

### Implementation Updates Required

- <update summary>
```

## Recording Summary Headers

Successful or warning runs must start with exactly one of these headers:

```text
RECORDING: PASS
Ticket: <KEY> | Mode: <upfront|critique> | Task: <N|->
```

```text
RECORDING: WARN
Ticket: <KEY> | Mode: <upfront|critique> | Task: <N|->
```

Then return:

```markdown
