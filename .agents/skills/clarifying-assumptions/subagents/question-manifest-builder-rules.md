# Question Manifest Builder Rules

Read this file after the critique report is validated and before building
the manifest. These rules are static so the subagent definition can stay
compact until assembly time.

## User-Surfacing Gate

Apply this gate before inventory or ordering. An item can enter
`Questions For Now` only when its severity is `HIGH` or a future severity
explicitly above `HIGH`. Items below that threshold stay out of the
developer-facing question loop.

For critique-report items, use the report's severity unless the item
documents unresolved contradictory current sources. Evidence-conflict
items are user-facing and should be normalized to `HIGH` in the manifest
row even if the report forgot to uplift them.

For plan-derived assumptions, open questions, validation failures, and
task questions, assign a severity before including them. Use `HIGH` only
when the item blocks execution, invalidates a core assumption, changes
user impact, or creates a material architecture, security, performance,
or maintainability risk.

Do not put `MEDIUM` or `LOW` items in `Deferred Questions` merely to keep
them visible. Deferred means a `HIGH` or higher item belongs to a later
task. `Resolved Irrelevant` means the item is no longer applicable. Keep
below-threshold items in the critique artifact and optionally summarize
their count in `## Manifest Summary`.

## Upfront Inventory

In `MODE=upfront`, consider these candidate sources, then apply the
user-surfacing gate:

- Problem-framing critique items from the critique report
- Technology critique items from the critique report
- Cross-cutting open questions from the task plan
- Architectural assumptions from the task plan
- Validation `FAIL` items from the task plan
- Task 1 questions from the task plan

Collect these as deferred only when they meet the user-surfacing gate and
belong to a later task:

- Task 2+ questions
- Task 2+ assumptions that should not be resolved yet
- New future-task questions surfaced by the critique report

In upfront mode, `Irrelevant` is normally `0` because future-task items
are deferred instead of marked irrelevant. Keep the `## Resolved
Irrelevant` section in the output and leave it empty unless a specific
item is no longer applicable.

## Critique Inventory

In `MODE=critique`, consider these candidate sources, then apply the
user-surfacing gate:

- Technology critique items for the current task
- User-impact critique items for the current task
- Deferred questions for `TASK_NUMBER` that still matter
- Current-task assumptions or open questions still unresolved

Collect these as irrelevant:

- Deferred questions already answered elsewhere in the plan
- Deferred questions invalidated by the current-task artifacts
- Deferred questions whose premise is no longer true

## Ordering

For `MODE=upfront`, order items like this:

1. Problem-framing `HIGH` or higher severity
2. Validation `FAIL` items that are `HIGH` or higher severity
3. Technology critique `HIGH` or higher severity
4. Architectural assumptions that are `HIGH` or higher severity
5. Cross-cutting questions that are `HIGH` or higher severity
6. Task 1 questions that are `HIGH` or higher severity
7. Dependency risks that are `HIGH` or higher severity

For `MODE=critique`, order items like this:

1. Critique `HIGH` or higher severity
2. User-impact `HIGH` or higher severity
3. Current-task assumptions or open questions that are `HIGH` or higher
   severity
4. Remaining deferred questions that are `HIGH` or higher severity

## Compact Briefs

For each item in the manifest, produce a short brief containing only what
the conversational skill needs:

- `Item ID`
- `Category`
- `Severity`
- `Model` (`A` or `B`)
- `Skippable`
- `Affected tasks`
- `Original decision or question`
- `Critique summary or context`
- `Fallback/default`

If an item is user-facing because of contradictory current sources,
include the conflict in `Critique summary or context` so the
conversation layer asks the developer to choose deliberately.

Do not copy entire artifact sections into the manifest.

## Item IDs

Preserve critique report IDs exactly:

- `PF<n>` for problem-framing items
- `TC<n>` for technology critique items
- `UI<n>` for user-impact items

Use deterministic IDs for plan-derived items:

- `A<n>` for assumptions
- `CQ<n>` for cross-cutting questions
- `V<n>` for validation items
- `TQ-<task>-<n>` for task questions
- `DQ-<task>-<n>` for deferred questions

Once assigned, keep the same `Item ID` throughout the manifest so the
conversation layer and `decision-recorder` can reuse it unchanged.

## Category Labels

Use human-readable labels that map directly to `decision-recorder`
categories.

| Manifest label | Recorder category |
| --- | --- |
| `Problem framing` | `problem-framing` |
| `Critique` | `critique` |
| `User impact` | `user-impact` |
| `Cross-cutting` | `cross-cutting` |
| `Assumption` | `assumption` |
| `Architectural assumption` | `assumption` |
| `Task question` | `task-question` |
| `Validation` | `validation` |
