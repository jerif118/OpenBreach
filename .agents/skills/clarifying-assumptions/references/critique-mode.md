# Critique Mode Playbook

> Read this file for `MODE=critique`. The skill loads it with
> `./design-thinking-mindset.md`; load `./conversation-protocol.md` only
> when Stage 4 starts.
>
> **Reminder:** Critique mode stays conversational for the developer, but
> subagents still own artifact reading, deferred-question filtering, and
> file writes.

Use `SKILL.md`'s escalation table for verdict routing. Load
`./clarification-contracts.md` only when validating paths, sections, or
derived handoffs. Fetch rationale from `./external-sources.md` only when
the developer asks why this mode uses user-impact or technology critique.

## Stage 2 - Analyze Artifacts

Read `../subagents/critique-analyzer.md`, then dispatch
`critique-analyzer` with:

| Input | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `MODE` | `critique` |
| `TICKET_KEY` | `<TICKET_KEY>` |
| `TASK_NUMBER` | `<TASK_NUMBER>` |
| `MAIN_PLAN_FILE` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md` |
| `ARTIFACTS` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-brief.md`, `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-execution-plan.md`, `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-test-spec.md`, `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-refactoring-plan.md` |
| `CRITIQUE_REPORT_FILE` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-critique.md` |
| `PRIOR_DECISIONS_FILE` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-decisions.md` |
| `PRIOR_DECISIONS_KIND` | `per-task` |

The analyzer consults the per-task decisions file on every run. If the
file does not exist yet, it treats the source as empty. When the file
exists, it judges prior answers by substance rather than item ID or exact
wording.

## Stage 3 - Build Manifest

Read `../subagents/question-manifest-builder.md`, then dispatch
`question-manifest-builder` with:

| Input | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `MODE` | `critique` |
| `TICKET_KEY` | `<TICKET_KEY>` |
| `TASK_NUMBER` | `<TASK_NUMBER>` |
| `PLAN_FILE` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-tasks.md` |
| `CURRENT_TASK_ARTIFACTS` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-brief.md`, `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-execution-plan.md`, `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-test-spec.md`, `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-refactoring-plan.md` |
| `CRITIQUE_REPORT_FILE` | `docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-critique.md` |

The manifest builder applies the `HIGH` or higher user-surfacing gate,
then returns the same three-way shape used in upfront mode: questions for
now, deferred questions, and resolved irrelevant items. A zero-item
manifest is valid.

## Stage 4 - Clarify Inline

Load `./conversation-protocol.md` and follow its preview, turn, response,
and recording rules.

Critique-specific rules:

1. Every item uses `Model=B`; do not run the Tier 3 Model A flow.
2. Resolve only current-task critique, user-impact, assumption, and
   deferred-question items.
3. If a deferred question is clearly obsolete, do not ask it; rely on the
   manifest builder's `Resolved Irrelevant` list.
4. Follow the manifest `Skippable` field. Items surfaced as
   non-skippable stay non-skippable.

## Stage 5 - Record Decisions

Read `../subagents/decision-recorder.md`, then dispatch
`decision-recorder` with:

| Input | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `TICKET_KEY` | `<TICKET_KEY>` |
| `MODE` | `critique` |
| `TASK_NUMBER` | `<TASK_NUMBER>` |
| `TASK_TITLE` | task title from the manifest |
| `ITERATION` | `<ITERATION or 1>` |
| `DECISIONS` | resolved decisions from Stage 4 |
| `RESOLVED_IRRELEVANT` | items marked no longer applicable |
| `DEFERRED_QUESTIONS` | new future-task questions created during discussion, if any |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_UPDATES` | implementation-note edits caused by revised decisions |

In critique mode, `decision-recorder` creates or updates
`docs/<TICKET_KEY>-task-<TASK_NUMBER>-decisions.md` and updates the main
task plan. After it returns, use `./conversation-protocol.md` to present
the final summary.
